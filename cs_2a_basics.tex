\paragraph{Population} is a set, of which we would like to learn some properties.
  
\paragraph{Sample} is a subset of a population, on which we calculate the properties and then make
statements about the whole population.

\paragraph{Random sample} is a sample taken in an unpredictable way, i.e. the method of taking the
sample involves an unpredictable component.

\paragraph{Self-weighting sample} is a sample taken in such manner that each element of population has equal
chance of being included in the sample.

\paragraph{Simple random sample} is a kind of self-weighting sample selected so that all samples of
same size have equal chance of being selected.

\subsection*{Remark}
Further on we in most cases assume random sample of size $n$, $X = \sample$.
